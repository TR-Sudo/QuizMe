# QuizMe

Welcome to QuizMe! Our new mobile study app focused on creating digital quiz sets. You can generate your own quiz sets and be provided with instant feedback on your success and understanding of the material. In addition, you will also be able to view and study from quizzes that have been submitted by others. If you're still not feeling confident in whatever topic you're studying, fret not! You'll be able to view postings made by tutors in your nearby area. Lastly, if you're a trivia buff, we also have a page full of random facts that you may find interesting!

## Getting Started

After cloning QuizMe, you'll need to set up your own .env file in the root path of the project to be able to access our 'Tutor' and 'Facts' screens. For our 'Tutor' screen, we recommend using MapBox for the map url and token. For 'Facts', please generate your own key from the following API: https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/facts-by-api-ninjas/  

The format of the .env file should be as follows:
```
MAP_URL="URL_HERE"
MAP_TOKEN="TOKEN_HERE"
FACT_KEY="KEY_HERE"
```

## How do I use QuizMe?

Screenshots have been provided in the '/Screenshots' folder that demonstrate the use cases for each QuizMe screen.
